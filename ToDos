# Inputs
# json: datetime (1/1/19 0:00, TIMEZONE), eload (kWh), Temp (F)
# Baseline start date - Baseline end date
# Reporting start date - reporting end date
# $/kWh (average)
# UserName
# Project Name

# ToDo
# Front End:
#   - Sanity Checks: Dates format (M-D-Y), name of columns (including Capital letters)
    - Plots baseline and Reporting period.
#   - If the user agrees -> transform data into json format, add all inputs and send data to backend
# Backend:
#   - Create endpoint to receive json and return a json. OK
#   - Get data, preprocess it into dataframe format
#   - Fits TOWT to the baseline, predicts energy consumption for reporting if no measure was taken
#   - Returns:
#       - json with datetime, consumption, temperature - baseline + fit, reporting + fit
#       - Model uncertainty
#       - Savings (kWh + $)
